# Laravel

The Laravel framework is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in most web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

## I. Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer
- A database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Livewire

## II. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nhanitk14dev/filament-dynamic-website.git
    ```

2. Navigate to your project folder:
    ```bash
    cd filament-dynamic-website
    ```

3. Install dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. Set up your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Laravel uses SQLite as the default database. You can also switch to MySQL if needed.

   5.1 Confirm the SQLite DB Location in `.env` file:
    ```text
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    ```

   5.2 Use a SQLite Viewer (UI)

   - **Option 1: DB Browser for SQLite (Recommended)**
     - Download: [https://sqlitebrowser.org](https://sqlitebrowser.org)
     - Open the `database.sqlite` file directly.
     - You can browse tables, run SQL queries, and edit data.

   - **Option 2: VS Code Extension (Recommended)**
     - üîç Search for **SQLite Viewer** or **SQLTools** in VS Code Extensions
     - Open the `.sqlite` file directly in VS Code.
     - Or use the **SQLTools** extension to connect and browse the SQLite database.

6. Generate the application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

7. Run migrations to set up your database:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8. Serve the application:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

Now you can open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
